    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Eggy bread, pain perdu or French toast â€“ this classic breakfast dish has plenty of names and just as many options for toppings. We like it with fresh berries.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>80 ml whole  milk</li>
        <li>40 ml double cream</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>4 thick slices of brioche</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>icing sugar and fresh berries to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together the eggs, milk, cream, vanilla and cinnamon. Lay the brioche slices in a single layer in a shallow dish and pour the egg mixture over them. Allow to soak for 2-3 mins, then carefully turn over and soak for 2 mins more.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp of the vegetable oil and butter in a non-stick frying pan over a medium heat until foaming. Carefully lift 2 slices of the soaked brioche out of the dish and add to the frying pan. Fry for 3 mins on each side, until golden and crisp, then place on a wire rack over a baking tray in a warm oven while you repeat with the remaining slices.</li>
        <li>Serve dusted in icing sugar and scattered with fresh berries, if you like.</li>
    </ol>
